Ego response \u00b6 [[What is ego]] \u00b6 Why do we avoid feedback? feedback is great! tell us we're doing something wrong so we can improve, be better at life We fear feedback if it damages our sense of self, ego Example: some clients are complaining about my attention to detail Boss says I did a bad job for reasons A, B C feel bad and take it personally Instead of realizing those are things I can fix my takeaway is \"I'm so terrible at this job, I'm never gonna be good, so many people who are better than me\" self fulfilling prophecy of failure not improving at A, B, C can't internalize the constructive feedback \"oh my god, I'm gonna screw up, I'm gonna screw up\" \"it's who I am\" \"who I am\" = unchangeable fixed part of personality, character, identity What to do in the performance review \u00b6 Anticipate emotions what's said in the performance review shouldn't be a surprise if it is, talk about it during 1 on 1s see [[performance-reviews#Avoid taking feedback personally]] Person based feedback (non-ideal): translate it into actions example: not a team player \"help me understand what that means\" \"what can I do to be more of a team player\" \"What do team players do that non team players don't do?\" Tell you're boss that you want to work on it Measurement conversation how do I know a week from now whether I'm making progress? how will we measure progress? Avoid taking feedback personally \u00b6 What would you tell a friend if they received the same feedback?
