# Fullchee's Notes

At Forma.ai, I implemented a docs-as-code at Formaaaaaaa.

[Read my Forma story here](https://fullchee.com/project/forma)

[Here's the work that went into implementing the docs-as-code solution at Forma](/technical/docs-as-code/docs-as-code)

I realized that I could use the same system to organize all my personal notes.

!!! note

	Internal links may not work on this site because I've switched to use `Obisdian`

	To get the full experience

	1. Clone the repo
	2. Open the `docs` folder in Obsidian

!!! note

    These are my personal notes so the audience is just me.

    When I write docs for others, it's more readable.

    Example pages

    - [Faster PyCharm Tests](/backend/python/django/django-testing/faster-pycharm-tests)
    - [Intro to promises](/frontend/javascript/async/intro-to-promises)
