Ask for the story: (that was amazing, how did you do it?) if you didn't know about it or if you did, do an nvc appreciation

Contextualize gratitude, say how it helps in a broader context, setting a great example for those resistant to change

Acknowledge the cost (time with family, emotional toll, political risks)
