Filling in a position is all about pain

-   I'm more concerned about whether we're a good fit.
-   If we're a great fit, then I can be flexible

Have leverage (multiple offers)

Be pleasantly persistent on non-salary terms

-   Asking for another vacation week because “I’m French”???
    Salary terms without success terms is Russian roulette
-   Define success in your position
-   Metrics for your next raise

Spark their interest in your success to recruit them as un-official mentors

-   What does it take to be successful here?
-   They will watch to see if you follow their advice
-   Personal stake in seeing you succeed
-   They're assessing you for how you will be their ambassador

How did you come up with this salary?

-   People at this company are being paid `_____` for this role

## Never Split the Difference

-   No deal is (almost always) better than a bad deal
-   genuinely empathize and understand
    -   Every other communication book reminds me of NVC by Marshall B Rosenberg
    -   I feel like this book is like another front for mindfulness with military terminology
        -   "Tactical grade" empathy and calibrated questions, are just empathy and questions to get to know them better
-   all the “tactics” can also be used to just create more connection with others
-   You can learn about black swans (unknown unknowns)
    -   example: the building actually has some structural issues so now we know the value is worth a lot less
-   Deadlines are never ironclad

### Language

#### Calibrated Questions

-   When you hear something you don’t like
-   How, what
-   Example

    -   Increased rent -> how am I supposed to pay for that?
        -   I want to pay my rent. How am I supposed to afford it? my salary is fixed
    -   Get them to help you solve your problem

-   Validate and label their emotions and mirror their words
    -   builds trust and safety
    -   “That’s right”
-   Say **no** a lot
    -   let them say **no**
-   -   “What” questions instead of “why”
        -   Only use them in cases like this
            -   Why would you ever want to switch from Xactly? They’re great

-   “You’re right”
    -   they’re not invested or trying to get rid of you
-   “I’ll try” -> “I plan to fail”

##### Fair

-   NFL owners: “We’ve given you a fair offer” (instead of showing their books)

    -   It sounds like you’re ready to provide some evidence

-   Tell them your deadline: reduce the risk of impasse, opponent will be quicker to be serious
-   How to respond to: we just want what's fair
    -   let's stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we'll fix it

Strategic umbrage

-   personally insulted and by a request
-   Creates pressure for you to back off

Negotiating style

-   Accommodator
-   Assertive
-   Analyst
-   How to approach each style?

### Ackerman Bargaining

This tip is from `Never Split the Difference`

-   65%, 85%, 95%, and 100%
-   start with an anchor
    -   normally I'd be pushing for \_\_\_\_
    -   then lower it after each amount
