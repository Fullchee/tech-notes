## Questions

-   How do we get better at our job?
    -   Our job doesn't get easier
-   Definition of "done"?
-   Why is this so hard?

## The most important thing for a piece of software

-   Real estate: Location location location
-   Software: is it useful? Useful? Useful?

## Definition of done

### Software parenting

-   Software maintenance doesn't exist.
-   maintenance is doing the same thing every year
    -   oil change
-   Every problem in software is different
    -   (like parenting)
-   you can only stop parenting when when the software is done/dead
    -   it's dead when it's no longer useful
-   analogy: baby -> adult (observability, auto re-deploy when it breaks)
    -   adult: only need help for extreme circumstances

Our job is to change software, not build it

## Automation

### Why automation?

-   Saves kreplets (attention unit)
-   Changes behaviour by making the right thing easier
-   [less yak shaving](https://fullchee-reminders.netlify.app/link/1928)
-   Safety
    -   Add a little check after something goes wrong so it doesn't happen again
-   Reproducibility & make docs simpler
    -   run this script to reproduce
    -   instead of run this script

Generativity

-   How much you contribute to the team
-   Team's productivity with vs without you
-   Automation is generative

## How much time should you spend to automate?

-   Time box
-   First time: ignore it
-   Second time, spend 15 mins
-   Third time: an hour
-   Then ask the group

## Best programming language

-   The best programming language is the one you already know
-   You can learn a new programming language in a few weeks
-   You can learn the build tools, the ecosystem, the major frameworks and libraries, the idioms, the memory considerations, the garbage collection in decades

## System mover, not system builder
