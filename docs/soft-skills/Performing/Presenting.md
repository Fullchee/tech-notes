## Questions to ask yourself (analog, no computer!)

* How much time do I have?
* What’s the venue like? (professional vs casual?)
* What time of the day?
    * Is it right after lunch?
* Who is the audience?
    * What’s their background
    * What do they expect of me / us?
* Why was I asked to speak?
* What do I want them to do? (what am I pitching?)
    * How do I want them to feel? Think?
* What visual medium is most appropriate?
* **What is my absolute central point? **(if the audience remembers only one thing)
    * Fundamental purpose of talk?
    * What’s the story?

For each point you want to get across
* What’s my point?
* Why does it matter

Would you be able to turn this into an elevator pitch?
* not always possible
* Figure out what’s important
