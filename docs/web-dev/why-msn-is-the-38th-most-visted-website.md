# Why `msn.com` is the 38th most visited website

I recently went on [the Wikipedia page of the mots visited websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_websites) in July, 2022.

To my surprise, I saw that `msn.com` was 38th and its ranking increased.

The only time I went to `msn.com` is when I was redirected when I logged out of `outlook.com`. That's not enough to explain its popularity though since logging out of email doesn't happen often.

When I used Microsoft Edge, I figured out that when you open a new tab, it also opens news articles from `msn.com` which are visible when you scroll down ðŸ˜’.

I've now installed an extension that makes the new tab page empty.
