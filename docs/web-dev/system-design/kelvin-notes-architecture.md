# Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices vs serverless vs edge

https://rubygarage.org/blog/monolith-soa-microservices-serverless

## Monolith

### Pros

-   Single self-contained
-   Simpler
    -   deployment
-   Fewer cross-cutting concerns
-   Better performance
    -   no need for 40 API calls between services

#### Cons

-   Codebase becomes sphaghetti
    -   tight coupling
    -   harder to add new features
    -   hard to onboard new devs
-   Difficult to adopt new technologies
    -   can break things if you update the Django version
-   less reliable
    -   breaking one thing can break everything

#### What it looks like

-   Front End: React
-   Monolithic with all the business logic
-   DB

#### When to use monolith

-   Forma
    -   to get stuff working asap
-   For most use cases????

### SOA: Service Oriented Arch

-   Reusable components
    -   ????
-   Enterprise Scope
-   Shared ESB
    -   Enterprise Service Bus
-   Uses SOAP, AMQP, MSMQ
-   Example: bank,

#### Pros

-   Reusability of services
-   Better maintainability
    -   modules that can be maintainted without knowing the whole system
-   Higher reliability
-   Parallel development

#### Cons

-   Complex management
-   High investment costs
-   Extra overload

Elastic Load Balance

AWS API Gateway

Services:

Deploy on EC2 (sever) or AWS Lambda (serverless)

Ex for farming sector:

\- Soil lab 1

\- Soil lab 2

\- Farm

\- Accountant

\- Market

RDS/Redshift,Redis,DynamoDB S3, Glacier

Caching

CDN

Kafka

Sharding

Fraud Detection

Microservice - Reusable components. Application Scope. Uses REST, JMS

Pros:

Easy to develop, test, and deploy

Increased agility

Ability to scale horizontally

Cons:

Complexity

Security concerns

Different programming languages

Architecture:

Front End - Angular?

Elastic Load Balance

AWS API Gateway

Microservices:

Deploy on EC2 (sever) or AWS Lambda (serverless)

Ex for Instagram:

\- Upload

\- View

\- Search

\- Account

\- Follow

\- Trending

\- Monitoring

RDS/Redshift,Redis,DynamoDB S3, Glacier

Caching

CDN

Kafka

Sharding

Fraud Detection

Serverless - Cloud computing, no infrastructure management. Uses FaaS (Frontend as a service) and BaaS (Backend as a Service). Accomplishing one-time tasks and auxiliary processes

Pros:

Easy to deploy

Lower costs (No DB, some logic, servers)

Enhanced scalability

Cons:

Vendor lock-in

Not for long-term tasks

Web Service Communication Protocols:

SOAP - ACID compliant, security, stateful

REST - Performs better, caching, less refactoring headache, stateless

graphQL - Quickly evolving product iterations, over/under fetch, stateless

Services May Include Machine Learning:

Preprocess using PySpark, Build and Train Using Sagemaker, Deploy to EC2

Classifier:

Random Forest -> Easy to overfit

Logistic Regression

Gradient Boost -> Longer to run, overfit

NN -> long train time, need lots of data. Complex hyperparameter

SVC

Naive Bayes

Regression:

RFR

LR

Decision Tree

Gradient Boosting

NN

Recommendation:

SVD -> Collaborative. Example: TasteWright.

Cosine Similarity -> Content. Example: Amazon Products

Hyrbid -> Use both. Example: Netflix

Clustering:

K-means

Images:

CNN

Text:

LDA

NN -> LSTM, CNN, Transformers

Sagemaker VS DataBricks

DataBricks is a better platform for Big data(Scala, PySpark) Developing.(unbeatable notebook environment)

SageMaker is better for Deployment. and if you aren't working on big data, SageMaker is a perfect choice working with (Jupyter notebook + SKLearn + Mature containers + Super easy deployment).

SageMaker provides "real time inference," very easy to build and deploy, very impressive. you can check the official SageMaker Github. https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/scikit\_learn\_inference_pipeline
