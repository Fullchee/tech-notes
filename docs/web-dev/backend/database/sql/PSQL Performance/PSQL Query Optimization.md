An Overview of the Various Scan Methods in PostgreSQL

## [[PSQL Debug Slow Queries]]


## `pg_stat_statements`

## Which queries have spent the most time?

```sql
SELECT
  query,
  round(total_time::numeric, 2) as total_time,
  calls,
  round(mean_time::numeric, 2) AS mean,
  round((100 * total_time / sum(total_time::numeric)
    OVER ())::numeric, 2) AS percentage_overall
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 20
```

Result

```
query
-----
<user>
"SELECT * FROM ...." (the actual query)

<user>
"SELECT *"
```

## Candidates for indexes

```sql
SELECT schemaname,
  relname,
  seq_scan,
  seq_tup_read,
  idx_scan,
  seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 0
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;
```

## Aggregate first

-   https://youtu.be/5M2FFbVeLSs?t=1206

```sql
SELECT name, count(*)
FROM gender, person
WHERE gender.id = person.gender
GROUP BY name;
```

is super slow because we're joining before aggregating (millions of lookups) compared to

```sql
-- aggregate on gender ID
WITH genders AS (
  SELECT gender, count(*) AS gender_count
  FROM person
  GROUP BY gender
)
SELECT name, gender_count
FROM genders, gender
WHERE genders.gender = gender.id
```

## Time Series Data

B tree entry is ~25 bytes

1. Partition by year
2. `brin` index 3. block range index 4. ![5dc21dee43c6e6c3418ae5ce1c927d96.png](5dc21dee43c6e6c3418ae5ce1c927d96.png)
