## What problem does tailwind solve?

When I make a change to the CSS
- Will it mess up something unrelated?
- CSS in JS

maintainability

have an exhaustive list of utility classes and design system

no duplicate styles


No need to install Bootstrap, then BEM in another part

Good for learning about good design practices
Default design system that can be modified


Debugging is tougher??? (according to Kevin Powell)
- inline styles
