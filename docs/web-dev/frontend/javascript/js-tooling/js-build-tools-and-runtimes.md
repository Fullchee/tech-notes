# JS Build Tools

[TypeScript Tooling Explained â€” Syntax Podcast 462](https://syntax.fm/show/462/typescript-tooling-explained)

## All in one tool

-   [Rome](https://rome.tools/)

## Compilers

2021 king: Babel

TS or new JS -> old JS

-   transpiling & polyfilling
-   minifying
-   packaging

2022 alternatives

-   TSC
    -   TypeScript Compiler
    -   TS -> JS
    -   the only thing that can **type check**
        -   errors out when there's a type error
-   SWC
    -   Speedy Web Compiler
        -   TS or new JS -> old JS
    -   [2022: might type check in the future!](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/571)
    -   used by `Deno`
-   [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) also compiles
    -   `Vite` uses `ESBuild` for compiling
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Bundlers

bundles all of your JS files into one file (for each page)

[Module Bundlers Explained... Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Snowpack](https://fullchee-reminders.netlify.app/link/2077)

2021 choice: WebPack

people want something faster

-   [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
    -   super fast
    -   will need to config a lot
        -   not ready for prod yet
-   Rollup
-   Parcel

## Dev server

2020 King: `create-react-app`

-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/comparisons.html#web-dev-server)
    -   replacement for `create-react-app` for single page apps
    -   built on ESBuild
    -   super fast rebuild times
        -   make a change in code -> changes apply in the browser right away
    -   uses `esbuild` and `rollup`
        -   might move away from `rollup` and only use `esbuild`
-   [wds](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/)
    -   web dev server
        -   powered by `ESBuild` and `Rollup` too

## How to run TS scripts from the CLI?

```javascript
node script.js
```

```ts
npx tsx ./script.ts
```

## JS runtimes

### What is a runtime

-   code that you need to run your code
    -   implements the features of the language needed to run the code

1. JS Engine
    1. parse your code and convert it to runnable commands
2. provide some objects to javascript so that it can interact with the outside world.

### Examples

-   browser
    -   you have `window`, DOM objects
    -   each browser is its own unique runtime
        -   has their non-standard experimental APIs
-   Node.js
    -   v8 engine & C++ libraries
    -   has buffers, processes
-   [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx)
    -   faster version of `ts-node` that uses `esbuild`
    -   Node.js + ESBuild to compile the TS
    -   `npx tsx`
        -   I can't seem to paste code snippets into it?
-   Deno
    -   V8 + SWC + Rust
-   [Cloudflare workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works/)
-   Google App Scripts
    -   mess around with Gmail or Google Sheets
-   Bun
    -   built from Zig (programming language) that does all the things above built-in

## JS Engine

-   aka browser engine
-   the central part of a JS runtime environment
-   parse your code and convert it to runnable commands
    -   what a runtime does: provide some objects to javascript so that it can interact with the outside world.

### Examples

-   V8 Engine
    -   Chrome
-   JavaScriptCore
    -   WebKit
-   SpiderMonkey
    -   Firefox
-   Rhino
    -   JS Engine written in Java

### [JS Engine vs JS Runtime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29027845/what-is-the-difference-between-javascript-engine-and-javascript-runtime-environm)

-   JS code -> runnable commands ()
-   usually developed by web browsers
-   used to just be interpreters
    -   now they're JIT compilers

#### Analogies

Robot playing music

-   JS code: music notes
-   JS Engine: robot who can understand the notes and act on it
-   JS runtime: instruments the robot can use
