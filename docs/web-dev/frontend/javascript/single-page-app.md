# Single Page App

aka SPA

## Benefits of SPAs

-   instant feedback (after slower load)
-   converting site to a PWA easier
-   transition to mobile apps is easier (same backend code)

## Examples of sites using a SPA

-   Spotify
    -   navigate around and click around and look at what else to play
    -   while the music plays in the background
    -   music doesn't get cut off when you click on the artist
-   Gmail
-   Google Maps
-   Google Drive

### When should you use a SPA?
* Good for gated content with long sessions

## Problem with SPAs

-   data is loaded on a as-needed basis
    -   tons of loading spinners
-   SEO
    -   Google can read static sites better/faster
-   the pit of success of SPAs is small
    -   easy to mess up
-   the best SPAs can provide the best app-like app

Probably shouldn't be the default way we write sites
