## EpicReact PropTypes confusion

I got a bit confused when I got to creating custom components extra credit where I'm not sure how React is calling the `propTypes` that we defined (not from the library).

-   [Course video link](https://epicreact.dev/modules/react-fundamentals/creating-custom-components-extra-credit-solution-03)
-   [Link to code](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals/blob/main/src/final/04.extra-3.html)

I broke it down in [this StackOverflow question]([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70477035/when-are-the-props-propname-and-componentname-passed-to-the-proptypes-func]) where I even tried looking at the `React` source code but I didn't explain my question clearly enough because the one response gave a link to the `propTypes`.

-   (which is interesting but not exactly what I'm looking for ðŸ˜…)

I'm also posted on KCD's discord (but didn't get a good answer)

I could (but probably won't) go to his office hours
