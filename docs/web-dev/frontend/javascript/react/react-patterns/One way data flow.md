## Why

1. Performance
	1. 2 way: constantly check to see if the view and the model are diff (slow)
	2. only change what and when you need to
	3. (analogy: stop motion photography)
2. easier debugging
	1. 2 way: too many things are changing the model, hard to isolate
	2. redux: time travel debugging
