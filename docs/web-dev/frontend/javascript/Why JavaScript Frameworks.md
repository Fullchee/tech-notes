Why React is popular despite bad performance?


## Economics 

- Not worth it to optimize for poor users
	- Who don't spend much
	- Slow networks & devices

## Frameworks decrease dev cost

Increase dev efficiency

- Someone has already solved your problem with React
- Communication: all teammates know where to find stuff and how stuff generally works faster
	- similar to something they've seen before
- Easier to hire people
- Dev time is more valuable than losing some tough customers
	- Don't have to worry about tough customers that don't pay a lot
	- Sacrifice poorer customers
	- Have to optimize too much 

Solution: better frameworks
