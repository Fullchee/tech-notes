# Assertions

## When to use vs throwing an Exception

Only to help other devs

-   documenting your understanding of the code at a point

    -   guarantees about
        -   inputs (preconditions)
        -   program state (invariants)
        -   outputs (post-conditions)
        -   like CSC494 & contracts

-   debugging a broken algo

```python
if condition1:
    pass
else:
    assert False, (
    "This should never happen, but it does sometimes."
    "We're trying to figure out why. Email us if you hit this!")
```

## When to not use assertions

-   data processing
-   data validation
-   error handling

-   assertions are usually disabled in prod

    -   performance

-   don't cause side-effects in assertions

```python
assert treeDepth() == 7;
```
