## Dark matter

tons of people that are there and you can't find on LinkedIn

> [!Why might someone have a typo on their LinkedIn profile?]-
> They spent ~1 min on their minimal profile
> - they created a LinkedIn to look at other people
>
>They might use an abbreviation
>Senior -> snr, sr
>Manufacturing -> mfg
>Software -> sw
>
>They could intentionally misspell it so that they don't get spammed
>- the hottest people are probably annoyed by always being asked

- tons of Google engineers that don't have a primary language

1. Search for `Cloud` and click on profiles
2. Look for terms that are synonymous with `Cloud`

	2. OpenStack
	3. Azure
	4. EC2
