# sed

## sd

-   Alternative to sed
-   https://github.com/chmln/sd

-   Replace newlines with commas:
    -   sd: `sd '\n' ','`
    -   sed: `sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/,/g'`

### sed

`sed -i 's;/resources;~/resources;g' repo.py`

you can use any delimiter char for a sed expression

-   doesn’t have to be`/`
-   if you know you’re going to have`/`
-   you can pick something else to avoid needing to escape `/` a bunch of times

### One liner to remove lines that match a pattern from a file

This example removes `[localhost]:56789` from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

```
sed -i '' '/^\[localhost\]:56789/d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

#### As an alias

```
alias rm-known-localhost="sed -i '' '/^\[localhost\]:56789/d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts"
```

A line in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` looks like

```
[localhost]:56789 name key
```
