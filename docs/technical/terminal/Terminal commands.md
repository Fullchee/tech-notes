## Search

### ripgrep (rg)

-   better than `grep`
-   [ripgrepall](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) also searches PDFs and other files - `brew install rga` - `brew install pandoc poppler tesseract ffmpeg`
    ????
    Example use cases

`lnav` has syntax highlighting for logs

### [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) CLI Benchmarking Performance

## Python list to bash

```bash
space_separated_strings=$(python file.py | tr -d '[],')

# We need the eval because ????
eval "for query_content in $query_content_list; do
    echo \$query_content
    psql2 $COMMISSIONS_DB -c \$query_content;
done"
```

You should just do everything in Python
Run the shell psql2 from Python

???? What did Viktor do?

## `su` vs `sudo`

-   `su` switches users
-   `sudo` keeps the current user, runs as if they were sudo
-   `su -` creates a new environment with the super user's env var and switches to their home directory
-   `sudo su -`

### Open a man file in Preview (as a PDF)

`man -t apropos | open -fa Preview`
