## MacroDroid

-   turn on Do Not Disturb mode
    -   Samsung only lets you have one time for Do not Disturb
    -   I want a schedule for work and sleep


## Tasker

### Turn on mobile data for an hour every day

If I lose my phone, during that hour, I can Find My Phone


- apps don't have permission to toggle mobile data
	- unless you're rooted
- workaround: Tasker and Tasker Secondary
